Monitoring

When we talk about monitoring DynamoDB, what we're really talking about is making sure that the latency of our Git and Put requests is within our expectations, and that all provision capacity is sufficient and we're not getting throttled. Here I am in AWS CloudWatch and you see that I have my DynamoDB setup here. From this, I'm going to actually get the dashboard, which is going to show me my average latency, as well as throttle requests and any errors that happen. In addition to this, I can create errors on the table itself by going to the AWS Console and pulling up the table and selecting alarms. I'm going to click the create alarm button. From here, I'll be asked what kind of alert I want to create and I'm going to select an email alert in SNS topic. The SNS topic is going to be baseball stats-throttled-reads. I just want to be alerted if we ever go over my provision capacity. I'll put my email address there and from my event, instead of unconsumed read capacity, I'll select throttled read events whenever that's greater than zero. I'll go ahead and create that alarm, and now I have that alarm, and this will be running in the background, and I'll get alerted. As you saw, there were some other signals in here as well, as the throttled write, as well as the latency alarms, as well as the size of data being returned. So I can create any kind of alert that I want to for this and this integrates with CloudWatch as well.
